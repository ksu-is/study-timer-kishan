TIMER.py
this is just a simple python study timer i made that runs in terminal. when you start it, it asks how many minutes you wanna study. you type a number, then it starts counting down. while it’s running nothing really happens, it just waits. when time is up, it says time’s up and tells you to take a break. after that it’s done and closes. it’s just for focusing, like a no distraction timer for people trying to get work or studying done. i might add stuff later like session tracking or sounds but for now it’s basic
